# Skyblock-Listing-Bot
ThankYou to zones for the listing bot<3

- Need to run "npm install skyhelper-networth" for list to work

- I think /whitelist doesnt work but easy fix and u can just whitelist manually in whitelist.json




# SETUP:

install dependecies or whatever
- 1. Go to /storage/config.json and fill in the info 
{
    "TOKEN": "",
    "CLIENTID": "",
    "GUILDID": "",
    "USERID": ""
}



- 2. Whitelist your server in /storage/whitelist.json
     {
    "serverId": "",
    "sellerRoleId": "",
    "customerRoleId": "",
    "vouchChannelId": "",
    "categoryId": "",
    "ticketId": "",
    "pingRoleId": "",
    "reactEnabled": true,
    "emoji": "",
    "mfaStock": {}
  }
]


- 3. Put your Hypixel API Key In /commands/list.js near the top (also use this to change amojis or whatever)
